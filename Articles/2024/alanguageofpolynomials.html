Each slide can be formalized even further as their own research paper but presenting in this manner allows my ideas to give intuitive bearing so that it gives people from various backgrounds to come up with their own theories, ideas, and applications. On the other hand, this is also a formalized proof in my style of construction. Source to github is <a href="https://github.com/ericung/languageofpolynomials">here</a>.
    </p>

<h3>1. Foundations</h3>

<img src="https://raw.seadn.io/files/9f75ebe154270e7e46563d2c73d175ea.jpg"/>

<p>There exists a language such that it decides each monomial in the polynomial. In other words, there exists a set of deciders for each monomial in the polynomial where it decides if y is in the monomial.</p>

<pre>
Given a polynomial p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c
p(x) = 3x^2 + 4x + 5
p(2) = 3(2)^2 + 4(2) + 5
p(2) = 12 + 8 + 5

Let the decider be defined as the following:
Decider is a function Decider(constant, degree, x) <=> constant*x^degree == y
such that
x1 * x2 * ... * x<i>degree times</i> * <i>constant times</i> is tested to be equivalent to y
and x1 is the start
and x<i>degree times</i> is the finish
then loop around x1 to x<i>degree times</i> until it stops

Decider for ax^2 is Decider(3,2,2) = 3(2)^2 == 12
Decider for bx is Decider(4,2,1) = 4(2)^1 == 8
Decider for c is Decider(1,2,1) = 5(2)^0 == 5

</pre>

<h3>2. Monomial of One Degree</h3>

<img src="https://raw.seadn.io/files/4cb6308ffe2e412653c4e97ef8d9f444.jpg"/>

<pre>
Given the definition of a decider:
Decider is a function Decider(constant, x, degree) <=> constant*x^degree == y

A decider of at least one degree

Decider(3,4,x) <=> 3x^4 == y
Contains Decider(3,x,3) <=> 3x^3 == y
Contains Decider(3,x,2) <=> 3x^2 == y
Contains Decider(3,x,1) <=> 3x^1 == y
Contains Decider(3,x,0) <=> 3x^0 == y

Hence it can be generalized to:
Decider(constant,degree,x) contains the sequence set 
{Decider(constant,degree,x),Decider(constant,degree-1,x),...,Decider(constant,0,x)}
{start,...,finish}
</pre>

<h3>3. Addition</h3>

<img src="https://raw.seadn.io/files/d96f3bac7ac6f73948312b45b9e84c84.jpg"/>
<pre>
Given the first example:
p(x) = 3x^2 + 4x + 5
p(2) = 3(2)^2 + 4(2) + 5
p(2) = 12 + 8 + 5

m2 = Decider(3,x,2) = 3x^2
m1 = Decider(4,x,1) = 4x
m0 = Decider(5,x,0) = 5

Generalized to mx where x is the degree

Given polynomial functions, p1 and p2, they are commutative
p1(x) = ma + ... + m0
p2(x) = nb + ... + n0

p1(x) + p2(x) = ma + m[x+1] + nb + n[y+1] + ... + (mx + ny) + ... + (m0 + n0)
where x == y

Decider(cx,x,dx) + Decider(cy,x,dy) = Decider(cx+cy,x,dx) = Deciders(cx+cy,x,dy) iff dx == dy
</pre>

<h3>4. Product</h3>

<img src="https://raw.seadn.io/files/10245ec92f9e33bdb10e3b33e57ff28c.jpg"/>

Given two monomials in the language, a and b, the product of a and b is also in the language.

<h3>5. Problem with Matrices</h3>

<img src="https://raw.seadn.io/files/8c1967ffe7f5daf06d4350a3d3cf8561.jpg"/>

<pre>
Given a polynomial p of x, show that the monomial deciders represented in the language can't be contained in a finite matrix after a set number, n, such that x^n.

axa * bxb = nxn such that a != b and a,b < n
</pre>

<h3>6. Multivariable Polynomials</h3>
<p>Multivariable Polynomials</p>
<img src="https://raw.seadn.io/files/5334b7a5857311d96aa143d6f183ed1d.jpg"/>

<pre>
A monomial with more than one variable can be treated the same way as handling single variables at different degrees.

Decider(c,xyz,d) = c(xyz)^d = Decider(c,x,d)*Decider(c,y,d)*Decider(c,z,d) where c is some constant

Decider(c,x,d1)*Decider(c,y,d2)*Decider(c,z,d3) = cx^d1*y^d2*z^d3 where c is some constant

Given f(x,y)=3xy^2
set x = 2, y = 3
f(2,3) = 3(2)(3)^2
f(2,3) = 27
</pre>

<h3>7. Generalized Monomial Deciders</h3>

<img src="https://raw.seadn.io/files/ff4203f024a9576acb591e9c2c5036fc.jpg"/>

<p>A monomial decider can be represented in a more general graphic</p>

<pre>
6x^6 <=> Decider(6,x,6) <=> 6*(xstart,x2,x3,x4,x5,xfinish)

x^6<=> Decider(1,x,6) <=> 1*(xstart,x2,x3,x4,x5,xfinish)

In both these examples, xstart is x1 and xfinish is x6.
</pre>

<h3>8. Concentric Monomial Deciders</h3>

<img src="https://raw.seadn.io/files/72ce7443198eb29d97c7ad4770f92587.jpg"/>

<p>Given a polynomial, p(x), with a monomial decider represented as ax^n in p(x) and n in N and a = 1 such that p(x) = x^n, there is special property for these monomial deciders that can be illustrated below.</p>

<pre>
Decider(1,x,4) <=> x^4 <=> {xi such that i is in {start,2,3,finish} and xi contains xi-1 where i > 1}

Decider(1,x,2) <=> x^2 <=> {xi such that i is in {start,finish} and xi contains xi-1 where i > 1}

In both these examples, xi is a state in the monomial decider.
</pre>

<p>Each state in a one constant monomial decider have a property of being concentric. This means that a state can be defined as, x2 <=> (x1,x0) so going from x1 to x0 then going to the next state x3 or looping back to x1.</p>

<h3>9. Constants</h3>

<img src="https://raw.seadn.io/files/1428c340ce1dbbb662d6ff2f8f36ce9d.jpg"/>

<p>Given a constant, c, of p or better described in the example: f(x) = 5. Constants are seen as linear directed acyclic graphs.</p>

<pre>
f(x) = 5

Decider(5,x,0) <=> 5 <=> {start,2,3,4,finish}
</pre>

There is no state in the decider where it loops back to the start. In other words, there is no x that represents a monomial in a constant.

<h3>10. Division</h3>

<img src="https://raw.seadn.io/files/94ae2bf0b54d8e05cee2ef5a7b7b4fc1.jpg"/>

<p>Division of monomial deciders</p>

<pre>
x^5 / x = x^4 <=> Decider(1,x,5)/Decider(1,x,1) ~ Decider(1,x,4)

x^5 / x^2 = x^3 <=> Decider(1,x,5)/Decider(1,x,2) ~ Decider(1,x,3)

x^5 / x^3 = x^2 <=> Decider(1,x,5)/Decider(1,x,3) ~ Decider(1,x,2)

x^5 / x^4 = x^1 <=> Decider(1,x,5)/Decider(1,x,4) ~ Decider(1,x,1)

x^5 / x^5 = 1 <=> Decider(1,x,5)/Decider(1,x,5) ~ Decider(1,x,0)
</pre>

~ here is represented as a special kind of equivalence that we will get to later.

<pre>
Decider(1,x,5)/Decider(1,x,1) <=> {sequence of permutations of {xi,xj} such that the count of i is 4 and j is 1}

Decider(1,x,5)/Decider(1,x,2) <=> {sequence of permutations of {xi,xj} such that the count of i is 3 and j is 2}

Decider(1,x,5)/Decider(1,x,3) <=> {sequence of permutations of {xi,xj} such that the count of i is 2 and j is 3}

Decider(1,x,5)/Decider(1,x,4) <=> {sequence of permutations of {xi,xj} such that the count of i is 1 and j is 4}

Decider(1,x,5)/Decider(1,x,5) <=> {sequence of permutations of {xi,xj} such that the count of i is 0 and j is 5}

Here, xi != xj, meaning xi is of a different representation than xj
</pre>

<h3>11. Multiple Divisions</h3>

<img src="https://raw.seadn.io/files/2df43686cd7fd850cd453038e80b4683.jpg"/>

<p>Given multiple operations of division, this forms an interesting space. x^5/x^2/x = (x^5/x)/x^2</p>

<pre>
Decider(1,x,5)/Decider(1,x,2)/Decider(1,x,1) ~ Decider(1,x,5)/Decider(1,x,1)/Decider(1,x,2)
iff ignoring order of operations
</pre>

<h3>12. Equivalence</h3>

<img src="https://raw.seadn.io/files/461399d26480185147f88d7356802314.jpg"/>

<pre>
Decider(1,x,6)/Decider(1,x,1)/Decider(1,x,1) ~ Decider(1,x,6)/Decider(1,x,2)
iff the order of operations is next to each other
</pre>

<p>
Determining if y is in f(x) is easy if we are given any monomial decider in the set of the language of polynomials and their representations has the possibility to give different representations if we consider them as representations of the function f(x).
</p>

<pre>
Decider(1,x,6)/Decider(1,x,1)/Decider(1,x,1) <=> {sequence of permutations of {xi,xj,xk} such that the count of i is 4 and j is 1 and k 1}

Decider(1,x,6)/Decider(1,x,2) <=> {sequence of permutations of {xi,xj} such that the count of i is 4 and i is 2}
</pre>

<b>Theorem of Equivalence</b>

<pre>
y is in Decider(1,x,6)/Decider(1,x,1)/Decider(1,x,1) == y is in Decider(1,x,6)/Decider(1,x,2)
</pre>

<h3>13. Reversing</h3>

<img src="https://raw.seadn.io/files/32081555fdc28346354d30e2af60e4de.jpg"/>

<pre>
Decider(1,x,6)/Decider(1,x,1)/Decider(1,x,1) <=> {sequence of permutations of {xi,xj,xk} such that the count of i is 4 and j is 1 and k 1}

Decider(1,x,6)/Decider(1,x,2) <=> {sequence of permutations of {xi,xj} such that the count of i is 4 and i is 2}

Is shown that by the permutation of the order of operations that Decider(1,x,6)/Decider(1,x,1)/Decider(1,x,1) is not the same set as Decider(1,x,6)/Decider(1,x,2)
</pre>
