                <p>
When I was five years old, I overheard my dad kill a grown ass, fully trained professional soldier when he was my age. I forgot which side the soldier was on but whichever side they were on was disgraced. Right after, he and his friend crossed the river but his friend was gunned down by the soldiers avenging him. My dad was actually brought to the states because they caught him and wanted to teach him a lesson. That is where I came in. I was put in the war factory and given scars that mend those minds that brought me here. In the end, I was given my freedom and the privilege to pick up a rifle to defend my new and only home I know. When I pick up a rifle now, I have to ask myself this question - what is the value of this living beingâ€™s life?
