    <p>There’s an army of sewer people living next to the river across the village of Smelly.</p>

    <p>Many of these people including me hail from this village and see the sewage people breathe our air that we claim as ours.</p>

    <p>We let them breathe our air because they make our village smell the way it smells.</p>

    <p>One day a sewer boy walked up to me and asked me for a potato I was carrying. </p>

    <p>He smelled and I did not like him - at first. </p>

    <p>He kept pestering me on my manners and style of dress. </p>

    <p>I got so irritated I walked away without giving him a potato.</p>

    <p>He kept following me so I made fun of his Googly eyes that kept popping out every time he moved. </p>

    <p>I got so angry I poked one of his eyes. </p>

    <p>He cried and ran towards a thick tree.</p>

    <p>I felt bad so I walked slowly towards him and while I did so, I heard his tummy growling.</p>

    <p>He’s a scrawny sewer boy. </p>

    <p>We shared names.</p>

    <p>I told the sewer boy to do chores for me for a month and he can eat more potatoes.</p>

    <p>And a month went by and he did his job. </p>

    <p>I asked him why he begs for scraps. </p>

    <p>He told me that sewer people are sick and don’t have a lot of food to eat.</p>

    <p>I let him stick around for a little while longer and we became good friends.</p>

    <p>At the end of the season we became good friends.</p>

    <p>He bid me farewell and left to beg for more scraps from other people in my village. </p>

    <p>A few years went by and he was back, a little bit more full last time I checked and better mannered but he’ll always have that same sewer mannerism.</p>

    <p>He remembered my name and I remembered his.</p>

    <p>He said thank you for the potatoes and gave me a hug. </p>

    <p>He then went on to do whatever sewer people do or whatever he does now - I don’t think he goes to the sewers anymore from the looks of him.</p>

    <p>He’s not producing the smelly air anymore and it doesn’t make me angry at the least because it smells better now.</p>

    <p>Except thinking about makes me curious so I followed him in whatever the sewer people do.</p>
    </p>
