    <p>
There’s an army of sewer people living next to the river across the village of Smelly. 

Many of these people including me hail from this village and see the sewage people breathe our air that we claim as ours.

We let them breathe our air because they make our village smell the way it smells.

One day a sewer boy walked up to me and asked me for a potato I was carrying. 

He smelled and I did not like him - at first. 

He kept pestering me on my manners and style of dress. 

I got so irritated I walked away without giving him a potato.

He kept following me so I made fun of his Googly eyes that kept popping out every time he moved. 

I got so angry I poked one of his eyes. 

He cried and ran towards a thick tree.

I felt bad so I walked slowly towards him and while I did so, I heard his tummy growling.

He’s a scrawny sewer boy. 

We shared names.

I told the sewer boy to do chores for me for a month and he can eat more potatoes.

And a month went by and he did his job. 

I asked him why he begs for scraps. 

He told me that sewer people are sick and don’t have a lot of food to eat.

I let him stick around for a little while longer and we became good friends.

At the end of the season we became good friends.

He bid me farewell and left to beg for more scraps from other people in my village. 

A few years went by and he was back, a little bit more full last time I checked and better mannered but he’ll always have that same sewer mannerism.

He remembered my name and I remembered his.

He said thank you for the potatoes and gave me a hug. 

He then went on to do whatever sewer people do or whatever he does now - I don’t think he goes to the sewers anymore from the looks of him.

He’s not producing the smelly air anymore and it doesn’t make me angry at the least because it smells better now.

Except thinking about makes me curious so I followed him in whatever the sewer people do.
