                <p>They say that out west thereâ€™s a man who wears a poncho covered in red and grey stripes.</p>

                <p>He walks when the sun is dimly lit by the cloud it covers. </p>

                <p>When he talks, dust from his rusting voice fills your face. </p>

                <p>He does odd jobs and contracts of various sorts to scrape by and make ends meet.</p>

                <p>No one really cares where he goes but they wonder how he comes back with scratches and dents on his body.</p>

                <p>Some people say he killed six men in front of a bunch of women then killed those women next.</p>

                <p>Some people say he is a pedophile and even a necrophile - the worst possible things.</p>

                <p>Some people even say say he is just a cold hearted, silver tongued bastard who goes out of the city to just pick on those foolish enough to leave.</p>

                <p>To me, he saved my life and gave me a place to live outside of the mad house I was brought into.</p>
